	<p class=info>You approach the skeleton however it takes no notice of you.</p><p class=info>Um, do you know the way to the DRAIN launch party, you ask it.</p><p class=info>The skeleton's melody slowly peters out and it lowers its trumpet. It gets up from the barrel and slides off the lid.</p><p class=info>It motions for you to get into the barrel, and you think to yourself you've made it this far so you might as well as you clamber in.</p><p class=info>As the lid is slide over you, the bottom opens up and you find yourself hurtling down a chute. You collapse into a peaceful chamber, furnished in beautiful silk. On an old wooden bench sits a frog chilling with a golden chalice in it's hand. Welcome, it says.</p>
