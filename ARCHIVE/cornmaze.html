				<p>Long ago in your youth you heard tales of the many spirits that succumbed to the treacherous depths of the DRAIN dungeons. Finally you bear witness to these ghastly apparitions, the imprinted memories of travellers who failed to find their way. As you stare at these branching paths, the room grows colder; out of the dirt comes a hydra-like being, made up of solely fish heads; it spins violently at you. Upon the entrance of this creature, the ghosts, each in their sick ass fits, begin to disperse down the many paths, ostensibly to their doom. As you see one of these ghosts in the Rick Owens AW09 collection, Crust, you perish of fear, having never seen anything this musty before.</p>
