				<p>On September 30th, 2012, Experimental Industrial Noise Punk Digital Rap group Death Grips announced that the long awaited release of their second LP, <i>No Love Deep Web</i>, was being held from release by their record label, Epic Records, until “sometime next year”.  The next day the band leaked the album on their Twitter account, SoundCloud and various streaming websites. What the cover, a photograph of producer and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgzSP05q0as" target="_blank">drum-god</a> Zach Hill’s penis with the album title sharpied on to it, drew in criticism it drew in surprisingly equal praise as a spit in the face of the creatively stifling and increasingly obsolete record industry. Later that day, it was revealed that Death Grips topped BitTorrent's "List of Most Legally Downloaded Music" following the release of <i>No Love Deep Web</i>, with 34,151,432 downloads. How did the abrasive, enfant terribles of hip hop generate so much hype?</p><div class="link">

			</div><p>Formed in 2010 in Sacramento, California, Death Grips consists of rapper MC Ride, drummer/producer Zach Hill, and producer Andy Morin. They released their first mixtape Exmilitary in April 2011 which slowly diffused through the internet to critical acclaim. The band remained elusive and rarely interviewed, with the only known member being Zach Hill. This aura of mystery they have kept throughout their career has shaped the bands image, an aspect that has now become almost as equally important as the music they create themselves. By maintaining this, fans were able to project their own theories as to who the members were, the meanings behind their actions and the reasons behind the band’s elusiveness itself. In one of their first interviews, the interviewer claimed the schedule behind their erratic local shows followed the lunar cycle, a ridiculous notion that the band neither confirmed nor denied. Even when asked to define their sound they responded vaguely, “Raw. Raw like wet pennies. Post-Christian, Post-Satan”, in turn fuelling the occult themes present in Exmilitary and the band’s presentation, and hence fuelling the fans’ endless speculation with a healthy dose of Lovecraftian flair.

			</div><p>A year after the release of Exmilitary, the band dropped their first LP, The Money Store, which garnered widespread critical acclaim for its bridging of punk and hip hop. Later that same year they released No Love Deep Web after a 4 day long ARG (Alternate reality game) promoting the album’s release. The ARG utilized the internet as its medium and sent the players on a quest through the actual Deep Web, forcing them to hop between TOR nodes and try to decipher encrypted files. This element of participation in the run up to an album was unparalleled and has yet to be copied since. Not only did this allow fans to participate in the traditional album release cycle, but it also dangled before them a thread that further fuelled speculation around the band and its actions. It was solved after 4 days, and at the end of the trail was a release date for No Love Deep Web as well as a free instrumental version of <i>The Money Store</i>.</p><div class="link">

			</div><p>Throughout Death Grips’ unexpected rise to fame, or infamy, depending on who you ask, their constant utilization of the internet to shape their image has been as critical to their success as their experimental and abrasive music. This curation of image parallels that of the glam rock groups of the 70s and 80s such as KISS, who coated themselves in makeup and outrageous costumes, the Black Metal groups of the 90s who immersed themselves in Satanism, criminal scandals and also a lot of makeup. Death Grips has bought this curation into the digital age and levied it deftly to aide their DIY marketing stratagem, generating endless amounts of buzz and speculation. In a way, this menacing online presence is every bit as real as the gaudy stage show of the glam rock wave, and equally as beneficial to their careers - where KISS capitalised on shock to generate hype, Death Grips capitalised on speculation. Love them or hate them, you can’t deny their influence on this decades modern music and how bands present themselves in the internet age.
