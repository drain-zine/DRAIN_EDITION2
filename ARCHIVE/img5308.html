				<p>Turning the corner, you come face to face with an inexplicably moist sign that ominously reads “silver, crystal, crafts, furniture, pictures, candles.” You wishfully imagine another lifetime, perhaps not one where you chose the path of adventure, in which your home would be littered with such beautiful material goods. Without warning, a strange beast with energetic, monstrous eyes materializes out of the sign’s wet drippings. A white glove, stained with what you hope isn’t blood, covers its mouth; the thing disappears and just as quickly reappears next to your left ear. “Would you like some garlic?” it asks, in a voice that transcends the passage of the natural world; each syllable is a mountain reduced to rubble, a forest razed to the ground, and an ocean parched. Before you can give an answer, it crawls into a small slat in the wall, yelling “SLATT!”</p>
