				<p class=list>The smell of birds is like the smell of birds and you can smell it coming. It is made up of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of birds with unfriendly beaks and friendly talons. Each bird looks different because not all of them are birds. </p><p></p><p class=list>
        	Some of them are bees that look like birds. But in the recent past, along came a hole where the bird-bees came through and often returned through. Some stayed in the wholly impenetrable void on the other side of the hole; I didn’t think it was a void though. I thought it was a church, but it really was just another hole. I don’t like being wrong, so I will file that away in the past as I am now in the opened present, looking out for the smell of birds. </p><p></p><p class=list>
        	The bees don’t smell. They are hidden in the smell of guano and the ocean, which also smells like guano while we sit on a pier. You did not ask to be here, so now I have to remove you from here, so now the ocean smells like guano while I sit on a pier. I am currently not at a pier because I don’t want to smell the birds. Rather, I feel the bucolic buzz of life as I house myself underneath some bricks in Tintern Abbey. I want to dig deeper into the debris so I can better understand what it means to nest in a tree. My wings are clipped by the stinging of the sun, and now I am a dog eating from the wrong dog’s bowl. Does anyone realize that what I am doing is wrong?
</p><p></p><p class=list>
        	There are too many peppers in the world. They turn fingers into tongues. I feel the idea of spiciness in my fingers. I am the king of spiciness in Greek mythology. Everything I touch burns up in a singular profile of flavor. I live in a world without the je ne sais quoi of umami. My efforts to remove myself from history are fruitless, so I try to write myself into the future. I will exist sometime later. I am writing my own future as a bird. </p><p></p><p class=list>
        	I will climb the invisible ladder of air, thinking it is the only way to escape the curled up snakes in the jungle trees. When I break out of the top layer, I will want to go back through the hole I made because I will witness the new world of shit and spice. When I look back down, the roof of the jungle will be whole again and I will be a void for the bees.
