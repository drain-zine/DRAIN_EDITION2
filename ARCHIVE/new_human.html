				<p>“Have you heard of Hegelian Revivalism?” cries a cacophony of cursed voices from beyond the door as you approach it. You open the door, only to reveal an overwhelming void of nothingness. The words that constitute the buzzwordy, faux-philsophical concept mysteriously reverberate throughout this space. You fall to your knees and begin to weep; a vision of a many-faced demon with frogs, toilets, hands, and trousers enters your mind. You wonder if the teachings of Hegel even should be revived; you scream, “I just wanted an artsy tattoo!” “Have you heard of Foucault?” it responds. You finally realize where you are: the 69th circle of hell, constituted purely of a student’s loose grasp on philosophers they heard about at a soiree. You will never escape this pit of despair..... </p>
