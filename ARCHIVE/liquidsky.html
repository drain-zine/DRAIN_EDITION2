Have you ever seen <i>Liquid Sky</i>? It’s one of my favourite films. Directed, co-written and composed by Russian cryptic Slava Tsukerman in 1982, it’s considered among the highlights of the avant-garde underground film movement known as ‘No Wave’. Though similar to the ‘French new wave’ for simply not giving a shit, the movement was different in its play with themes of punk anarchy and grotesque political and social unrest. It especially flourished among the New York art communities back in the late 70’s to mid 80’s, an era when the city was squalid but fun and not the gentrified block it is today. Many of these films were shot on borrowed or stolen Super 8 cameras and shown in theatres around the Lower East Side. These films were cheap, crudely made and simultaneously beautiful in their ugliness. <i>Liquid Sky</i> is just that, a gorgeous ugly little thing that captures the raw reality of the art scene at the time: petty, narcissistic, grotesque and frequently faux. </p><p>Margaret is the film’s heroine, a fashion model with a love for glare posture and heroin. She runs from a wasp-like existence in Connecticut to the glass towers and neon-lit clubs of New York City,  banishing her fears of being a nobody and becoming the model she always wanted to be. But this fast-paced life isn't perfect, as she finds herself at odds with rivals, lechers and a gallery of men who force themselves upon her. Additionally, unbeknownst to her, a group of spectral, microscopic aliens have come to New York in search of heroin and have their eyes on Margaret. These aliens soon find out that the pheromones released from the brain during an orgasm are far more preferable to any drug and begin to absorb it from Margaret’s sex partners, killing them in the process. Although she doesn’t understand what’s exactly happening, Margaret begins to use this newly discovered ability to remove all the people that had exploited and abused her. As she follows this path of sexual empowerment and revenge, Margaret slowly loses her grip on reality, ultimately attempting to leave with the aliens at the end of the film.

<p>The film is cynical and deliberately unfriendly to the conventional standards of filmmaking at the time. It’s unique in its nonconformist plot and visually so with its art direction. Costumes are predominantly garish yet incredibly styled, scenes are lit in deep neon and sets are decorated with bohemian art and imagery. There are frequent scenes and moments that seem to be purely devoted to cinematography. Its portrayal of artists as tormented and narcissistic even holds true to an extent today.
</p>
<p>One key theme of the film is its discursive treatment of sex. Margaret, a bisexual nymphomaniac, doesn’t really care who she sleeps with until she realizes she can make her partners vaporize into nothingness after having their endorphins absorbed by the aliens. In the decade <i>Liquid Sky</i> was made in, questions of what exactly STDs were and how they were transmitted were becoming more commonplace; the otherworldly, quite literally alien forces around sex were a direct response to this concerned, general lack of understanding about such diseases.

“I was taught that to be an actress, one should be fashionable, and to be fashionable is to be androgynous. And I am androgynous not less than David Bowie himself. And they call me beautiful, and I kill with my cunt. Isn't it fashionable?”
</p><p>Similarly, the film’s fluid approach towards gender is refreshing. Both Margaret and her rival, an androgynous model named Jimmy, are portrayed by Anne Carlisle. Margaret’s abusive roommate and boyfriend, a heroin dealing beatnik with a necrotic obsession, is played by the actress Paula E. Sheppard. The only characters who bring up any traditional notions of gender in a strict sense are the conventional and conformist ones. It’s easy to see how this film influenced the queer community and the Club Kids scene that would both emerge in the late 80s. <div class="link">

</p><p>This might be a short article, but truthfully, I just wanted an opportunity to talk about it/ Hopefully I’ve convinced you to even watch it. There are a small handful of films that have influenced not just my work, but also who I am as a person, why I am like I am, helping to explain my own identity, and <i>Liquid Sky</i> is unquestionably one of them. I adore the power of the image, even in the sometimes puerile fashion that constitutes it. I really do identify with Margaret, as someone with no greater desire than to stand out and express themselves through their body and image. 
</p><p>
I love this film, and I'm smiling. Things aren’t as bleak as they seem, when I turn my eyes upwards toward the <i>Liquid Sky</i> of existence…</p><p class=info>- J.C.W</p>
