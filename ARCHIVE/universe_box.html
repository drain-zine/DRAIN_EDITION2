				<p class=list>Sometimes I travel to that place up among the sapphire clouds and lose myself in their blinding radiance. There I see more than I have ever seen: waterfalls swirl around in spirals, tear vast holes in the air and then pour into them, creating deep dark pools in the sky. The pools interrupt the barren sky – an oasis in the middle of a desert.</p><p></p><p class=list>
        	The air becomes thick and viscous, clinging to everything and holding it in place. But what is this “place”? Everything folds inwards and compacts itself into one box-shaped figure filling one single unit of space. And with everything occupying one place, the concepts of place and space cease to exist. There is simply everything. And as the air holds everything in place, the air is everything, and there is no change. Everything remains everything: the death of time.</p><p></p><p class=list>
        	Yet there are clocks here, within this folded-up box of everything. The clocks are here, folded too, the hands still ticking away as they count units which no longer possess meaning.</p><p></p><p class=list>
        	Are shapes still possible there inside the box? Is everything that was folded together now uniform? And how can there be a past state – a previous time where things existed in separate places, spread apart – if no present state exists? Perhaps this is just a period of homeostasis – a pause in time, or even a journey beyond it. Within this box no time can exist, but perhaps that doesn’t stop it existing elsewhere.</p><p></p><p class=list>
        	I let the box unfold again and catapult its contents outwards in all directions. Harsh shards of block colour explode outwards, then soften, as though melting, and mix together to reveal forms once more, beautiful stains on the nothingness that previously inhabited these vast plains.</p><p></p><p class=list>
        	Clouds form on the pools of water across the sky. The water turns to ice with holes which then crack and splinter, before shattering like glass, sprinkling sparkling icy pearls down below. The jagged pearls fall together into a necklace. I pick it up and put it on. Walking through a world of time and space where the waterfalls flow forever downward, I will carry my dangerous, dazzling necklace always, ensuring the clouds above are forever sapphire to me.
