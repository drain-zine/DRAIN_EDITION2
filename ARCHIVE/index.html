				<p>“Oh my! I have not seen a traveller in the depths of these dungeons for many centuries!” The bookish devil speaks with a voice that reverberates through your skull. You shiver, not because of this hellish visage, but rather because you are finally feeling the effects of the sweet sludge known as MONSTER ENERGY you consumed a few hours ago. “Can you hear me young squire? I have a few things I’d like to share with you.” The devil chortles poorly and chokes on a bit of his own saliva. Your legs are trembling. You need to find a bathroom, but will you sacrifice the opportunity to get into the fabled DRAIN launch party? The choice is yours...</p>

				<p>A pair of ghosts hover nearby as you ponder your decision. You have never seen them before, but you inexplicably seem to know their names: Dr. John Hasted and Willi G. They turn toward you and give smiles that warmly invite you to investigate the mysteries of psychic spoon-bending with them. You inch toward them. “Please do not come near my son, the sweet Willi G!” yells the ephemeral doctor. You inch backwards as Willi G zips through the ceiling and then floats back down, translucent can of beer in hand. A nearby torch briefly flickers, and suddenly the two are gone; the secrets of these spirits remain lost in these musty corridors forever.</p>

				<p>Next to the devil by the entrance is a skeleton slumped against the dungeon wall. It is wearing the newest Craig Green x Moncler puffer. As you approach, a disembodied voice rings through your head - "Is this the way to DSM? I hear they are having a deep sale on Paul Harnden Shoemakers. Yeah I like fashion I guess ha ha. I'm [REDACTED] nice to meet you haha, you come to DSM often? Oh you like fashion too? he he then why are you wearing those Fila Disruptors. I'm sorry that was just a joke haha they look good on you." You tell him that you are trying to get to the DRAIN launch party and you are met with silence.</p>
