				<p>“He — for there could be no doubt of his sex, though the fashion of his time did something to disguise it — was in the act of slicing at the head of a Moor which strung from the rafters.” This opening sentence of Virginia Woolf’s 1928 Orlando: A Biography, though outwardly operating in a purely descriptive capacity, in Woolfian style, betrays much more than what lies on its displayed surface; the “He,” in reference to the titular Orlando, a figure inspired by Woolf’s lover Vita Sackville-West, quickly becomes a figure of ambiguous, perhaps discursive identity. The faux-biographical confidence in his “sex” is complicated by the “fashion of his time,” something which carries an implied elegance that is immediately tempered by the sentence’s flourish of rehearsed violence.</p><div class="link">

			</div><p>Simply put, Orlando is a book that thrives in the realm of delightful instability and discursive pleasure as it follows its subject, Orlando, from his early years in Elizabethan England, to her magical, inexplicable transformation into a woman, ultimately all the way through 1928, when her poem, labored over for centuries, is presented as being published. This invested play in boundaries, most notably in the spheres of gender and temporality, mark the text as a rather appropriate influence for Rei Kawakubo’s Comme des Garçons in the greater history of its subversive, provocative, and undeniably significant take on what fashion could and can be. Kawakubo’s vision comes as part of a three-part sequence: two SS20 runway shows during men’s and women’s Paris Fashion Week and on stage in Olga Neuwirth’s operatic staging of Orlando this December, for which Kawakubo designed the costumes.

<p>The first two parts of this trilogy were lauded for their remarkable deconstruction of notions of linear time and binarized gender. These runway looks are inspired by the various periods of history Orlando lives through, more conceptually-inclined notions - particularly “darkness” and “obscurity” - and even an imagined future that bordered on science-fiction, marking an extension beyond the boundaries of the text that feels very much in the spirit of it as a whole.</p>
<p>However, despite these rather triumphant successes on Kawakubo’s part, Orlando’s 
implied questions of trauma, feel notably absent from these shows. To return to the opening sentence of the novel, the “act of slicing at the head of a Moor” becomes a recurring image that reminds Orlando of her past masculinity later in life and inescapably is a reminder of a violent moment in England’s history. An investment in the color black for the mid-show looks acts as a bridging centerpiece between past and future in these collections, one that arguably offers a brief moment of reflection on these traumatic ambiguities, but the way they dissipate into something generally futuristic and forward-looking still seems dismissive in some capacity. Does a turn towards fluidized expression in Kawakubo’s play with Orlando necessarily surmount these histories?

<p>Within recent popular culture, the same questions of history’s malleability raised by an examination of Kawakubo’s presentations have seemed to crop up elsewhere, namely with Frank Ocean’s newly launched queer club night, “PrEP+.” GAYLETTER magazine described the night as “an homage to what could have been of the 1980s’ NYC club scene if the [HIV/AIDs preventative] drug PrEP... had been invented in that era.” The event positively aimed to create a queer safe space as well as spread awareness of the drug. However, it quickly received backlash for its revisionist portrayal of history, essentially ignoring the existence of the HIV/AIDs epidemic and those affected by it. This sentiment is succinctly echoed in New York activist group ACT UP’s tweet in response to the event’s announcement, “We love you Frank, but 80’s nightlife was revolutionary because of people living with HIV and their caretakers. Let’s uplift our elders and honor their legacy.”

<p>As major figures in their respective spheres of culture, Kawakubo in fashion and Frank Ocean in music, each, given their status in the public eye and potential for influence, have a responsibility to carefully convey their visions. In a current political era where historical fact is warped to detrimental extremes, contemporary culture must be aware of all the nuances of the source material where it draws its influences from. Though Kawakubo’s collections successfully champion a deconstruction of gendered binaries within fashion, a movement which may have a trickle-down effect in years to come, the absence of managing moments such as the “slicing” of the “Moor’s head” irrevocably stains the effort as a whole. Similarly, although Frank Ocean may be actively creating a safe, queer space, the realities of HIV/AIDs during his cited period of influence become irresponsibly relegated to the wayside. Subversive takes on conventional notions of temporality are realistic possibilities as evidenced by Kawakubo and Frank Ocean’s accomplishments, but perhaps to successfully and responsibly represent such forward, progressive goals, history must be incorporated faithfully, even with its burdenining, difficult traumas  in order to actualize generative change.
