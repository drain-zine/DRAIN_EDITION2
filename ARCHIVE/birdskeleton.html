				<p>The small tunnel is poorly carved; its time-worn dirt walls noticeably crumble under your gaze, but this is no problem for you. The adventures of yore have posed greater challenges than this! You head through, when an intense brightness strikes your pupils. It comes from the piercing stare of a five-eyed, massive, elegantly trimmed living wall that surveys its cavernous domain. A bird with the face of a young Hugh Grant drops a bag of slime in front of it, and a man crawls out of the wall. He rubs his hands together, yelling “time to feed!” You remain unseen, but your tummy rumbles; will you attempt to join in this feast? </p>
