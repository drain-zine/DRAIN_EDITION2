<p class=info>"Uh, is there a toilet here?" you ask, and the devil motions towards a small and perilious passage lit sparsely by smouldering torches affixed to the cobbled walls. "Take this in case you wake up the Beast of Foul Depths", the devil says as he hands you an old scroll. The smell of feces becomes stankier as you make your way down the corridor until you reach a rotting wooden door labelled "R Mutt. 1917"</p><p class=info>The door creaks as you push it open, revealing a small cobbled room.

				<p>On the 16th of September 2019, Georgian designer Demna Gvasalia announced his exit from the evocative fashion house Vetements. In a press release to WWD, his brother Guram stated: “What Demna has accomplished over the past few years represents a key chapter in the story of Vetements...”. Demna Gvasalia has been working for Balenciaga as creative director since 2016, and the creative avenues he explored in Vetements have been slowly seen creeping into his collections at Balenciaga; oversized fits, exaggerated silhouettes and pop-culture references drenched in irony. We can see Vetements as a staging ground for Demna and his more radical ideas, ones that can be seen echoed in the art world near 100 years prior with the Dada movement - playing with the boundary separating art from the mundane (or in this case haute couture and utilitarian fashion). Going further we see how Vetements pushes that boundary in the impersonal yet deeply socially connected digital world, co-opting traditionally utilitarian household names and giving them a new cultural meaning.</p><div class="link">

			</div><p>Vetements was started in 2014 by brothers Demna Gvasalia and Guram Gvasalia, bringing together a collective of friends with experience ranging far across the more traditional fashion world. Since then the brand has been labelled as disruptive and subversive for staging shows in sex clubs, old churches and most recently inside a McDonalds, as well as using people taken from the street as models for impromptu shows staged outside of the usual fashion week schedules. The brand reached notoriety for its appropriation of the DHL uniform and reselling it for upwards of $300, as well as through pieces featuring newspaper horoscopes, copy-and-pasted wikipedia articles and ironic self-deprecating pieces such as the “overpriced hoodie”. The tongue-in-cheek pieces and meta-awareness of the brand and how it fits within modern fashion culture made Vetements truly unique, a product of the digital age. Its awareness of ironic internet culture positioned it perfectly within the marketplace, leveraging memes and reactionary press articles to further project the brands reach. It caused many to question larger issues in the industry as a whole, such as exhoreberant price tags and lazy graphic design practice as well as what is and what is not fashionable.

			</div><p>We can draw parallels between the work of Gvasalia and its interaction with the fashion world to that of the influential American-French artist Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp is most known for his readymades, a common mass produced object, referred to as objet trouvé (Found Object), which was then modified, reoriented or combined with another objet trouvé. Philosopher Arthur Danto referred to this process as making the original object “about something” - shifting it from its primary purpose as a useful object to that of a meaningful object, making it part of a new category, “art” and elevating its existence to that of the “artworld”. Duchamp referred to his readymades as a direct challenge to “retinal art” , art that exists to appeal to the eye, and instead demonstrate the value of art as an intellectual expression. Through the readymades he offered a “form of denying the possibility of defining art”. The most visceral example of these readymades is Duchamp’s Fountain, a urinal rotated and signed “R. Mutt 1917”, which was famously rejected from exhibition by the Society of Independent Artists  for being “by no definition a work of art“. The piece was then photographed by Alfred Stieglitz in Duchamp’s studio which catapulted the piece into infamy. Art philosopher Stephen Hicks quipped “In selecting the urinal, his message was clear: Art is something you piss on”.</p><div class="link">

			</div><p>We can see strong correlations between Duchamp’s readymades and that of key pieces in Vetements’ catalogue. For their SS2016 collection Vetements released a series of DHL worker T-shirts. This we could argue is a mundane uniform becoming couture through curation of the designer and the elevation of a functional piece into a meaningful piece of fashion, just like that of an objet trouvé into a readymade. One could also raise the point that DHL itself is an instantly recognisable brand but one that has not existed in popular culture in of itself, instead taking on only a utilitarian function. By projecting this objet trouvé into Danto’s “artworld” its utilitarian function morphs into one of cultural capital. Either by purchasing the actual pieces or even sharing memes about them, people demonstrate their knowledge of the current cultural moment. Duchamp’s readymades found meaning in the questioning of arts definitional boundaries and we see the DHL shirt found meaning through similar questions posed to the fashion industry, its practices and how it interacts with the internet. The shirt prompted questions as to what is and what is not couture, prompting essays from philosophers, outrage from British rags, and spawning countless memes and Instagram fits.  Here we can draw parallels between traditional couture and that of the retinal art Duchamp described, and how the DHL piece questions couture’s obsession with materiality and authenticity; what is really different between spending $200 on a DHL shirt from Vetements and a $200 plain shirt from a lauded designer such as Yohji Yamamoto? Why should we take the latter as being normal in the industry and the former as not? This existential questioning was exactly what Duchamp’s readymades evoked at the turn of the century, as well as the other products of the Dada movement - the questioning of authenticity through the countless collages produced (such as Duchamp’s L.H.O.O.Q) and the questioning of the traditional aestheticism associated with the  pre-WWI art world. We can also see this in Gvasalia’s Balenciaga SS2017 collection with his $2000 Ikea bag. Why could one justify spending $2000 on a plain Valentino leather bag and not the Balenciaga Ikea bag? It is obvious that these pieces are self-aware and are designed to invite as much debate from the industry and the public, just like much of the art produced by the Dada movement. Similar to that of the DHL branding, the IKEA branding conjure the vision of a traditional utilitarian brand that has now been morphed into one of a cultural brand, as seen by the litany of IKEA-themed fits posted to instagram and fashion forums after the bag’s drop. In a sense, the art now informs the cultural narrative through the internet, as opposed to the art being a product of that narrative. Gvasalia continues this questioning, in a way trolling, in his tenure at Balenciaga. We see pieces such as the double shirt push X to the extreme, collaborations with organisations such as the World Food Programme call into question collab culture that has taken the fashion world by storm, and the continually exaggerated silhouettes question the role of fashion in the rejection of gender and the body’s form. </p><div class="link">

			</div><p>In conclusion we have seen how Vetements has leveraged the internet in a truly unique way to bring about fundamental questions relating to fashion and the industry at large, similar to that of the Dada movement questioning the traditional notion of art that had been taken for granted at the turn of the century. The brand succeeded in its unique meta-awareness about the culture fashion has spawned around it, particularly the culture born from the internet, to spread its questions and ethos far beyond what traditional brands have done.</p><p class=list>- T.S.</p><div class="link">
