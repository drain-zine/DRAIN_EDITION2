        Your interest is piqued by a curious, verdant scent wafting out of a ominously shadowed corner of this otherwise completely average pub. The youths in your birth-town often loitered around the graveyard, listening to The Smiths and zooting pipe tobacco, but this feels different to you. As you walk towards this odor, the darkness is parted by a drifting cloud of green smoke, one that begins to take on the shape of a finger as you near it; you feel your nostrils, plagued by the advent of seasonal allergies, filled with the song of a thousand trees and the gleeful laughter of gnomes. Closing your eyes, you smile, but the gnomic chuckle grows louder. 
        
        “This is no simple reverie my friend!” exclaims a voice that pierces through this moment of serenity. You quickly shake your head to regain your composure, only to see an absolutely dripped out gnome in front of you. He lowers a silver-coated pipe into the light, revealing a strange insignia. 
        
        “You know what this is, my dumbfounded friend?” 
        
        Dumbfounded is right, you quietly think. What could this sign be? A cross in the middle, surrounded by a horseshoe like shape with the words “Gnome Hearts” inscribed in it; could this be some kind of metallurgic-gnomic-fungal cult, slowly ready to take over the world? Perhaps a fanatical band of equestrian-enthusiast religious zealots? 

        “You know what I’m wearing, friend?” asks the gnome. “It’s all Gnome! Gnome Hearts, of course.” He steps up from a toadstool, also with this same logo, unveiling an outfit fully composed of this “Gnome Hearts,” from the most curled-up point of his shoes to the tippy-top of his traditional gnomic hat. 

        “Reselling Off-White Nike Collabs has been crazy profitable my friend!” The gnome strokes his many rings. “You have some p you’re trying to spend?”

        You have no idea what this very cool gnome is referring to, but you enthusiastically nod your head. 

        “Hee hee! Come with me my good friend!” The gnome pulls up his long-sleeve GH jerkin, rubs his belly, and the Gnome Hearts insignia begins to glow on his belly button. He gestures for you to touch it, and you find that you can’t resist. As your finger traces this glowing outline, you realize that you’re no longer in the same pub...
