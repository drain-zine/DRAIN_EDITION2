“Your profile picture is a little scary, but I think I know that mask. I used to wear one of those for wrestling. Did I really look that intimidating?” My friend’s fleeting ruminations make me re-examine my Discord profile picture.

The subject of the photo looks just to the side of the unseen camera; they wear a t-shirt and cap with the phrase OTTO 958, the name of the collaborative project between Bulgarian-born, London-based designer [Kiko Kostadinov](https://kikokostadinov.com/) and Los Angeles’ [Morán Morán art gallery](https://moranmorangallery.com/), fully visible on both. Despite the other curiosities of this image—the uniform-like quality of the clothes; the backdrop of warehouse ephemera; the deadened expression of the subject—my attention turns consistently to the mask that this figure wears, the same one that my friend indicated some degree of familiarity with. I had initially thought it was something used for bondage, but even though it turned out to not necessarily be used for that purpose, this mask still allows for the assumption of a different kind of identity predicated on a sense of power and domination not present in the day-to-day lives of many; through such a mask, one could potentially become someone else entirely. But in this photo, actually a product shot for the very hat in it, the mask seems to have an additionally distorting effect upon the individual wearing it; drawing on a Freudian notion of the uncanny, their eyes bulge out just slightly enough to not be immediately noticeable, but when finally seen create a lingering, terrifying-in-its-familiarity sense of dread. 
With all its imagistic, affective play, the OTTO 958 mask, which seems at least for now a visual hallmark of the sub-label-cum-gallery-project (for lack of a fully encompassing term), may be the perfect representation of the intricate web of Kostadinov’s multi-layered universe, one that effortlessly weaves fashion, art, and critical theory together.

In the [collection notes](https://kikokostadinov.com/aw21-mens-text) for the label’s AW2021-22 Menswear collection, theory fills a vital explanatory role:

*"[The collection] continues the designer’s intrinsic exploration of hauntology - a Derridean portmanteau of ‘haunting’ and ‘ontology’ that prescribes the ghostly return of elements from the past. Originally referring to Marxist theory and later applied to music, cultural memory and Retrofuturism, when applied to fashion a hauntological reading allows for the postmodern ‘non-origins’ of Kostadinov’s designs to exist as a construct of myriad, non-linear references."*
For Kostadinov, Derrida serves as a familiar point of departure for the rest of the influences that feed into the collection, ranging from “speculative” pieces of literature that strive to challenge conventional “reality” to the delightfully imagistic “Alien Ikebana.” However, “hauntology,” which here is described as directly “[prescribing] the ghostly return of elements from the past,” informs how these disparate elements are seamlessly weaved throughout the [garments themselves](https://kikokostadinov.com/aw21-mens-silhouettes), compositely an imagining of a referentially dense, atemporal space shrouded in a vaguely religious, undeniably futuristic haze. 
If “hauntology,” in Kostadinov’s conception of it, is characterized as an “intrinsic exploration” for the designer, then perhaps it can be extended, by merit of association with him, to the workings of OTTO 958. The wrestling mask, under this form of thinking, draws on a history that exists outside of the boundaries of the collaborative project, namely that of its associated sport, while also inserting itself as an early, visual reference point that continuously informs and colors the living present, as traceable through the occasional release of new products. It is in this space that a garment, as the material representation of fashion, becomes transformed into a discursive, cultural object, one that finds itself inextricably linked to its cultural and digitally navigable contexts; for Kostadinov, the synthesis of all these is nothing new, it is simply just an opportunity to posit his developing relationship with all these individually moving parts, jointly forming a contemporary vision of interdisciplinary interconnectivity.
