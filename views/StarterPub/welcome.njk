You push open a completely unadorned wooden door, one of such a
plain-looking quality that you find something rather sublime about it.
As you step through, you find yourself in a completely normal pub. The
footy is on the telly, as they say back home, and a friendly barkeep
tends a wooden counter covered in Fosters’ beer mats. Behind him are
more tellies with the footy mate. You think to yourself that this
doesn’t have much executive energy; surely no one has a pair of Air Dior
1s (in the subtler low version, of course) or is a work-from-home
dropshipping entrepreneur. As you ponder the questionable finances of
this establishment, seeing that you are Esaria’s largest Travis
Scott/Astroworld merchandise reseller, you hear a shout, one that you
inexplicably understand is just for you.

“Bonjour!” yells the barkeep. “Don’t mind the French, just a bit of
jokes.” He laughs. “What it’ll be for you? A Stella? A Fosters? A
Guiness?”

You walk over and twiddle your fingers, the ones with the Chrome Hearts
rings on them, hoping he doesn’t realize that you’re 16.

“Aw mate, I’m just pulling your leg. You think we look like one of those
fancy pubs with more than one beer? We’ve only got Hobgoblin mate, your
choice to take it or not. You’re not a little lager boy are you?” He
eyes you up and down before giving a cheeky grin.

You nod silently as a mug of beer appears in front of you.

“Second most important ingredient next to hops is a bit of magic,” says
the barkeep as he tries his best to do a hearty wink. “Take a seat,
relax! First one’s on me.”

You leave the bar and take a seat at one of the tables. Hm, seems like
they use the Virgil Abloh / Ikea furniture here. “Not bad” you think.
You could get used to the easy life here, taking your first sip of
Hobgoblin, a real man’s drink.
