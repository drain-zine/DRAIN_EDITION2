            <p>
              As you look around the pub, you spy an erudite-seeming, but
              tattered-looking goblin sitting at a table perfectly in the
              center, vulgarly fondling its nether reasons. Although disgusted,
              you can’t turn away. What is this goblin doing? Continuing to
              watch, you see it pull a ratty tome from down below, one so vile
              that green cartoonish stink lines actively shoot out of it. The
              goblin sips from a mug with a foul and dark crystalline liquid in
              it and belches loudly.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Hm, Sanchez! Theories of time travel here. Wormhole. Dialectic.
              Where’s my spork, heh. Humph!” mumbles this musty fellow.
            </p>
            <p>
              This all sounds familiar, but you conclude that this goblin must
              just be a nerd. “I heard that! Hragh hrupgh” coughs the goblin as
              it turns to you. “You think I’m a nerd? I can hear your thoughts
              my friend... my mind is a proverbial and literal panopticon, come
              come, I must tell you something. Perhaps you won’t think I’m a
              nerd after I bestow this knowledge upon you.”
            </p>
            <p>
              You find yourself captivated by this goblin’s turn into linguistic
              lucidity and decide to make your way over.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Pube?” the goblin asks, extending a hair inexplicably connected
              in the form of a perfect ouroboros. “The snake eats itself.
              Two-heads. From consumption comes life. Do you understand?”
            </p>
            <p>You shake your head ambivalently.</p>
            <p>
              “BRECHT” belches the goblin, throwing the pube into the air. “No
              no no no, not the philosopher you two-legged numbskull, that’s
              just my ale speaking.” It smirks. “Are we the performers, or are
              we the audience? Reach into my pocket. You already have! The world
              is my pocket. Space is relative. Take a sip of my drink, and
              you’ll understand.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The goblin’s pubic hair floats with a feather-like serenity onto
              the bridge of your nose. You sneeze. You reach for the goblin’s
              beer, but it snatches it away.
            </p>
            <p>
              “No! You don’t understand! This IS the dialectic, but you’ll never
              see that if you keep drinking lager! Let me check my notes...” The
              goblin checks its notes. “Hm, yes, all going according to plan.
              Noted. Yes. Shoo now, I must return to my studies.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The goblin throws its mug at your head, which you narrowly dodge.
              You don’t hear the glass breaking anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Hm, interesting.” It belches. “Transmutation. Pure air. element.
              Coexist. Jerry. Brecht. I MEAN him this time. Good. GO!”
            </p>
            <p>
              You leave this goblin be and return to your table, unsure whether
              you’ve become enlightened or just more confused. Feeling an itch
              behind your ear, you reach to scratch it, only to find the
              goblin’s self-consuming pube somehow there...
