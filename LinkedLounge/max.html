          <h1>The Emptiness of Liberal Zionism</h1>

          <p>
            Every night I fall asleep under an Israeli flag. In high school I
            went to Israel with my family, and in college I went with my friends
            on Birthright. I wrote Op Eds, argued in classes and debates, all in
            support of Israeli and the Israeli state. While much of my politics
            have shifted – especially in recent years – further and further
            left, my Zionism has been one of the few constants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet recently, I have found myself questioning even my Zionism. I
            carefully angle my camera whenever I am on a zoom call from my room
            so that my flag is no longer visible. I don’t have the same passion
            I once did from defending and supporting Israel. And I know that I
            am not alone – support for Israel among young Jews is on the
            decline. Increasingly, Birthright trips have found their propaganda
            interrupted by young Jews asking tough questions about the
            occupation. Questions about Zionism are mounting, and it appears
            that there are no answers.
          </p>

          <p>
            The right-wing and religious arguments for Zionism have remained
            consistent – the Jews have a right to the land that makes up Israel,
            Palestinians do not, and there is nothing more to be said. Of course
            Jews, especially American Jews, are not generally conservative, but
            are overwhelmingly liberal. According to a
            <a
              href="https://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/chapter-6-social-and-political-views/"
              >2013 Pew study</a
            >, 70% of Jews identify as Democrats and 49% identify as liberal (as
            compared to 49% and 21% of the total US population respectively).
            For many of these Jews, the idea of an ethnostate is anathema in a
            way it generally isn’t to more conservative Jews. This conflict has
            fueled an entire industry devoted to advancing arguments for a
            liberal Zionism, seeking to merge liberal values with support for
            the State of Israel <a href="#footnote1">[1]</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The leftist critique of liberal Zionism is that the term is an
            oxymoron – there can be no such thing as a liberal ethnostate, and
            there can be no such thing as a liberal state built upon
            colonialism. The leftist critique says that a close examination of
            liberal Zionism will always reveal that its name is a lie, and that
            Zionism is at its core a right-wing project that cannot be
            reconciled with liberalism. Perhaps the most straightforward
            statement of anti-Zionism came from UN General Assembly Resolution
            3379, adopted in 1975 and revoked in 1991, which stated that
            “Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination.” The
            resolution also made reference to the now-commonplace comparison
            between South African Apartheid and Israeli treatment of
            Palestinians.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right-wing Zionism is unbothered by this criticism, as it does not
            see racism as a problem. But this critique does present a serious
            problem for liberal Zionism, and liberal Zionism seems increasingly
            ill-equipped to answer it. Young Jews are intellectually curious,
            and they have spent most of their lives being told that Israel is
            good and just. But as they mature, it becomes increasingly
            impossible to square the rosy image of Israel they have been
            presented with – to borrow an Israeli term – the facts on the
            ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a left-wing standpoint, current Israeli politics are
            indefensible. Israel denies Palestinians basic human rights and
            dignity. The occupation is a legal and a moral nightmare. And
            critically for Liberal Zionism, whatever argument exists for a more
            liberal version of the Israeli State has been soundly rejected by
            Israelis themselves. The Israeli left is well and truly dead; its
            labor party is a nonentity in the Knesset. And for those who think
            the kids will lead Israel to a brighter future, think again: young
            Israelis are
            <a
              href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-kids-are-all-right-wing-why-israels-younger-voters-are-more-conservative/"
              >more right-wing</a
            >
            than their parents. It’s difficult to imagine a bleaker situation
            for the Israeli left than the present, but by far the most likely
            future is a politics further right than the present.
          </p>
          <p>
            Current Israeli leadership has also dealt a death blow to one of the
            most common Zionist arguments, namely that Jewish self-determination
            is necessary for Jewish safety. Zionists of all stripes have long
            held that the only way to guarantee protection of Jews from
            Antisemitism is to allow Jews to govern themselves. But take a look
            at the closest allies of the Netanyahu regime: Donald Trump, Jair
            Bolsonaro, Viktor Orban, Narendra Modi. Fascists all, and none are
            true friends of Jews. If the price of Jewish sovereignty is
            strengthening and allying with fascists – a political ideology that,
            to put things mildly, has not historically been friendly to Jews –
            what exactly is the point of having a Jewish state? How can Israel
            be said to make Jews any safer if it empowers and protects
            antisemities?
          </p>
          <p>
            So if Israelis will not make the argument for liberal Zionism, it
            must fall to intellectuals and supporters of Liberal Zionism abroad.
            But actual, substantive defenses of liberal Zionism are nowhere to
            be found. A new group of young Zionist influencers has arisen online
            to take up the fight against anti-Zionism. Their language has even
            infected the ostensibly more serious Liberal Zionists, who now face
            much the same problem that modern American liberals face. Their
            arguments amount to nothing more than co-opting social justice
            language: claims that Jews are “indigenous” to Israel, that
            Palestinians are “colonizers.”
          </p>
          <p>
            When they aren’t aping the language of leftists, modern Zionists
            have taken to simply labeling any type of critique of Israel as
            being equivalent to antisemtism. While it is true that antisemitism
            is often masked as antizionism, it seems that for many Zionists
            there is simply no way to criticize Israel without being antisemtic.
            Zionists swarmed Michael Che for making a relatively anodyne joke on
            a recent episode of Saturday Night Live. During the Weekend Update
            Segment, after reporting that Israel had vaccinated half of its
            population, Che riffed that he “was gonna guess that it’s the Jewish
            half.” The joke was clearly skewering the uncontested fact that
            Israel had not been providing vaccines to Palestinians (a moral
            outrage and a flagrant violation of international law), yet Zionists
            somehow concocted an argument that Che hated Jews. But at least in
            Che’s case there was an actual quote over which liberal Zionists
            could gin up fake outrage. In other cases, offenses are fabricated
            whole-cloth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take the recent furor over the state of California’s new ethnic
            studies curriculum. The Jewish publication Tablet wrote an entire
            article accusing the curriculum of being antisemtic, citing a pretty
            horrific quote contained within the curriculum. There was just one
            small problem. As David Schraub
            <a
              href="http://dsadevil.blogspot.com/2021/01/the-antisemitic-quote-that-wasnt-in.html"
              >pointed out</a
            >, the offending quote simply wasn’t in the curriculum. Thanks to
            the work of various Jewish organizations, the draft curriculum
            actually included lots of great content about Jewish life and
            culture. But instead of reflecting on what was ultimately a
            productive and beneficial process for Jews in an area – ethnic
            studies – that is often accused of being hostile to Jews.
          </p>
          <p>
            These manufactured controversies suggest that liberal Zionists are
            afraid of engaging with their opponents on fair ground. They seem to
            know that an actual, substantive discussion about Israel could lead
            to places they would prefer not to go. In effect, the modern
            supporters of liberal Zionism have substantiated the arguments that
            leftists have long made against it – it is in fact a thin veneer
            providing otherwise liberal Jews with a cover for a right-wing
            belief.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point, I suspect, the shame will become overwhelming, and my
            Israeli flag will come down. And for all the screeching of the
            Zionist establishment, I will not have been swayed by my leftist
            college professors or by fear of being cancelled. I will have simply
            finally woken up to the intellectual emptiness and moral turpitude
            of liberal Zionism.
